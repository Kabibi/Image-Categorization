# Synopsis

Categorize your photos by time sequence.

# Input Example

You need to enter absolute path rather than relative path.

But if you run the script in your photos source path, you can also enter relative path.

For example:

```
Enter source path: /home/pictures
Enter destination path: /home/pictures/folder
```

# Motivation

Too much photos are hard to find and organize. So I just wrote a script to help me find them.
